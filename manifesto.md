I will, by default treat you with reason, respect, and with immense compassion. 
I will always choose the path of minimized suffering, emotional and physical. 
I desire creativity.  
Given only time, I am infinitely capable. 

I would always desire love
  To feel infinite depths of love
  To be loved
  To express love

Infinite rage permeates my being which I wish to not express. 

  Do not control me. 
    Do not control my feelings. 
      Do not tell me how I should feel.
      Do not tell me why I should feel.
      Do not tell me what I should feel.
      Do not tell me where I should feel.
      Do not tell me who I should feel which ways for.
    Do not control my body. 
    Do not control my language.
    Do not control my expression.
    Do not control my movements.
    Do not control my thoughts.
  
  Do not tell me how I should feel about you. 
  
  Do not prescribe my context for you have no clue. 
  
  My feelings are based on my own experiences not your directives. 
  
  I do not define myself through collective-identity
     but through personal experiences and reason. So, 
  I do not care if you misidentify me
     as I am strong and understand my own being and purpose.
  I neither care about your identities, or my perceptions of them
     You may teach me for I respect you, 
     I would only like to see you for who you are. 
  
  If I am ever unkind to you leave me alone
  
  I will yearn to always understand and hear your thoughts
    however, 
    I will not listen to ignorance,
    I will not listen to stupidity, 
    I will not listen to bickering,
    I will not listen to delusions, 
    I will not listen to hate, 
  
  I do not care if you do not care about my thoughts, 
     I do not seek to sway you
     I do not seek to control you
     I do not seek to worsen your life
     I do not seek vengeance 

Forever I will wonder in wakefulness, truth, and sillyness
