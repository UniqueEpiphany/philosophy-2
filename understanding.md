Rigel Rozanski Side point (center point? = ME): Just to be totally clear, this
conversation is about ME the centerpiece of the dialog. I don't like the
academic community, it's an isolated echochamber of obfuscated word garbage
(generalization). SO I'm excited to comprehend YOUR ideas on the basis of no
prior knowledge required. I'm talking: baby me through your ideas like your
first born. Explain to me the history, tell me your experiences, draw the
connections. MAKE IT MAKE SENSE. 

@Oliver - Cool points, wish there was some kind of an expanded format blog post
* cough * medium * where we could take the time to really unwrap some of those
points (with input from cool friends). My desire is to have a super clear
discussion about a couple of JPs ideas, namely ideas surrounding group
identity, without the academic jargon juice, you know something a non-academic
could read, comprehend, and apply. I haven't yet been able to find any writings
which satisfy this, however I have of course come up with my own rational
critiques. 

^ I think this is why JP has broad appeal, he lays out the argument from the
ground up (if any foundations are clearly lies obviously that's a good place to
start for a critique) - I think in this way, given the audience, any critique
which is to have lasting impacts must be written in the same form, the baby
form, for me, rigel, your most favourite child who knows nothing, I want your
ideas to hug me.


Oliver Samuda I agree completely about the wack ass obscurity of academia! give
me time to think of where the ground lies upon which I can build up my
arguments; although i agree with your analysis of JBP's appeal lying in the
clarity of his arguments, i would make the counter-argument that his greatest
weakness lies in making deeply complex topics appear far simpler than they are
in truth. ideas should be accessible, but there is some advantage to an
academic context in which prior knowledge can be assumed, from which we filter
out what is right and wrong

@Oliver Responding to "but there is some advantage to an academic context in
which prior knowledge can be assumed" 

Yes of course this makes sense (if people knew what they were talking about),
and when the time is right and an idea has been refined into something of true
value worth disseminating, then that idea should be regrounded into something
palatable for 5 year olds - I don't get the sense that this is common practice,
probably because the idea can't be regrounded because it's dung. I suspect, the
embedded assumptions in some of the "prior knowledge" can creep up on you and
invalidate an idea if one is not meticulous, so it's valuable to reground your
ideas often even before planning on sharing them. 

Personally, I literally don't take anything at face value, this includes common
knowledge and what some consider facts. In that sense, I don't even really
trust ideas from authors I like, although I may be swayed to consider them in
more depth, similarly I don't discredit ideas from authors I think are terrible
humans, although I may not give the idea the time of day. Unless an idea has
been proven to me through experience or good ol' rational comprehension it's
just spam. Hopefully if others really take the time to digest knowledge the
assumptions/constraints an idea carries with it can be parsed and considered
when forming new ideas from those assumptions - unfortunately, I doubt most
people and academics take the time to consciously understand ideas in this form
- it becomes obvious when listen to them speak. As so concludes why I'm
skeptical of academic writing with literally any prior knowledge required, in
other words I'm generally distrusting of people's capacity for comprehension -
and actually my own capacity for comprehension, nice to constantly be making
sure I'm not operating on unknown assumptions. ME
